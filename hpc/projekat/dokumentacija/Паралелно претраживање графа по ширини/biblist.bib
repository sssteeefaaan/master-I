               graph-based pattern recognition based on vector space embedding
               of graphs. It aims at condensing the high representational power
               of graphs into a computationally efficient and mathematically
               convenient feature vector. This volume utilizes the
               dissimilarity space representation originally proposed by Duin
               and Pekalska to embed graphs in real vector spaces. Such an
               embedding gives one access to all algorithms developed in the
               past for feature vectors, which has been the predominant
               representation formalism in pattern recognition and related
               areas for a long time.",

  abstract  = {Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal technique used in many applications as a building block, e.g.,~to systematically explore a search space. For modern multicore processors and as application graphs get larger, well-performing parallel algorithms are favourable. In this paper, we systematically evaluate an important class of parallel BFS algorithms and discuss programming optimization techniques for their implementation. We concentrate our discussion on level-synchronous algorithms for larger multicore and multiprocessor systems. In our results, we show that for small core counts many of these algorithms show rather similar behaviour. But, for large core counts and large graphs, there are considerable differences in performance and scalability influenced by several factors. This paper gives advice, which algorithm should be used under which circumstances.},
